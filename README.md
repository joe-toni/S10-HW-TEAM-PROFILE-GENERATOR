##  Description
For this program we were supposed to create a command line interface application that would take a user's input and generate a stylized HTML file with the information ofevery employee properly displayed. This was done through the creation of classes that would correctly house the corresponding information of each employee. Every time an employee was created it would be pushed onto an array of objects. That array would then be passed to a helper file that would generate HTML for the entire page using template literal with a card div for each of the objects in the given array. Our main file would then write the file in a folder located within our directory for the user to view, save, or copy. That same folder also contained a style sheet that would render the output in a manner resembling a given example. The user should feel free to use that resource as well if they'd like.See the video link below for a demonstration of the application.

### Installation

This program uses jest for testing and inquirer for the prompts. While it technically can run without jest it needs inquirer to be able to obtain user input. Because of this a package.json file was included in the directory with both dependancies listed, so the user only needs to run npm install in order to obtain the dependancies. After wards a terminal with node capabilities is needed to run the app.

---

### Usage

This program creates a generic sheet to display a teams information, it can be used to generate team profies in relation to that but not much else.

---

### Testing

 After Installing the dependancies and running on node the user can interact with the app through the command line. They could test how the lay out is affected by the number of entries and how the links work depending on the input.
